## Policies and expectations
I reserve the right to adjust the policies in this syllabus on a case-by-case basis.

**E-mail**
Please email me from your CSU Fullerton account, as other email addresses may be filtered into my Spam folder.

Allow me 24 hours to respond to your email before sending a follow-up email. My response time may be slower in the evenings or over weekends.

**Attendance and Participation**
If you miss any classes during the first week without notifying the instructor or the departmental office within 24 hours of the meeting, you may be dropped from the course.

Attendance and class participation are important components for success in this course. We will work through assigned in-class problems during our meetings.

You will be expected to work in groups on in-class assignments. Be respectful, and make sure all team members have completed the task. The teamwork grade will be factored into the participation grade.

You may also be asked to post in the Discussion Board. Before doing so, review the Forum Rules on our Canvas course site.

**Assigned Readings**
You will be assigned a few sections of material to read prior to most class meetings. These are crucial for your understanding of the material in lectures and participation in in-class assignments.

**Homework**
For homework, you will need to provide a written solution which will be uploaded with any relevant code as a PDF document.  Three possible ways of accomplishing this (in order of decreasing preference) are
* typing your solution in LaTeX on Overleaf and then compiling and downloading the resultant pdf.
* writing your solution and using a scanner or smartphone to scan it as a PDF document and upload it
* using some other word processor such as Microsoft Word to create the document and then export it as a PDF
Homework will also involve some online Canvas quizzes that will help you assess your understanding of different topics.  These will not have a time limit and can be done at home, but should be completed individually.

## Exams
Exams will take place during class at the times stated below. You will come to class and take the exam during the specified time.  Note that you must have video with both your face and hands visible and a working speaker and microphone during the exam.  The microphone should be muted during test-taking in order to not disturb your peers.

If you have an accommodation from Disability Support Services (such as time-and-a-half), it is your responsibility to coordinate with the instructor before each exam.

**Midterm Exams**
There will be three midterm exams, each lasting 1 hour.
Each midterm will be worth 15\% of your final grade.
Midterms will be held during class time on the following dates:
* Wednesday, September 21, 2022
* Wednesday, October 19, 2022
* Wednesday, November 16, 2022

**Final Exam**
The final exam will be cumulative with both written and computational parts, and will account for 30\% of your grade.
It will be held Wednesday, December 14 from 5PM-6:50PM
