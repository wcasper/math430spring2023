### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* uploaded onto a sketchy website and subsequently minted as an NFT

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**

Encrypt the phrase BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH using Caesar cypher.


**Problem 2:**

A certain phrase was encrypted using the following process:
1. Letters are converted sequentially into numbers 0 through 25.
2. Each number $$P$$ is converted into a new number $$C$$ by $$C = 3P + 7$$

This resulted in the phrase RXQTGU HOZTKGH FJ KTMMTG.  What was the original statement?

**Problem 3:** Solve each of the following quadratic congruences

* (a) $$x^2 + 7x + 10 \equiv 0\mod 11$$
* (b) $$3x^2 + 9x + 7 \equiv 0\mod 13$$
* (c) $$5x^2 + 6x + 1 \equiv 0\mod 23$$

**Problem 4:** Let $$p = 2^k + 1$$ be a prime (a prime of this form is called a Fermat prime).  Then every quadratic nonresidue of $$p$$ is a primitive root modulo $$p$$.

**Problem 5:** Find the value of the following Legendre symbols:
* (a) $$(19/23)$$
* (b) $$(-23/59)$$
* (c) $$(20/31)$$
* (d) $$(18/43)$$
* (e) $$(-72/131)$$
