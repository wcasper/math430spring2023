### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* written on ancient parchement with a quill and then flown to the instructor via owl post like in Harry Potter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**

Use induction to prove that

$$\sum_{k=1}^n k(k!) = (n+1)!-1.$$

**Problem 2:**

Prove that if $$1+a>0$$ then for all $$n\geq 1$$ 

$$(1 + a)^n\geq 1+na.$$

**Problem 3:**

Kelly collects colorful sea shells on the beach, which she separates into bags to sell.
In her experience, as long as she collects at least $$12$$ shells, she is able
to separate them into bags, each of which contains $$4$$ or $$5$$ shells, with
no shells left over afterward.
Use strong induction to prove that this will always be true.

**Problem 4:** 

Let $$n\geq k\geq 0$$ be integers.
Prove the following facts about binomial coefficients.

* (A) $$\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k} = 2^n.$$
* (B) $$\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k\binom{n}{k} = 0.$$
* (C) $$\sum_{k=0}^n k\binom{n}{k} = n2^{n-1}.$$

**Problem 5:** 

Recall the $$n$$'th **triangle number** is 

$$t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$

* (A) Prove Aryabhata's formula (circa 500 A.D.)

$$t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + \dots + t_n = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6},\quad n\geq 1.$$

* (B) Prove that for all $$n\geq 1$$,

$$\frac{1}{t_1}+\frac{1}{t_2}+\dots+\frac{1}{t_n} < 2.$$
