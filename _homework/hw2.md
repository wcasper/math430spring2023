### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* read aloud in class as a classic poem in iambic pentameter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**

Prove that for any integer $$n>1$$, the integer $$(10^n-1)/9$$ is not a perfect square.

**Problem 2:**

For any integer $a>0$, show that $$7a^3+5a$$ is divisible by $$6$$.

**Problem 3:**

For each of the following statements, decide if the statement is true or false.
If it is true, prove it.  If it is false, provide a counter-example.

* (A) If $$a \mid b$$ then $$a \mid bc$$
* (B) If $$a \mid b$$ and $$a \mid c$$, then $$a^2 \mid bc$$
* (C) If $$a \mid b+c$$ then either $$a \mid b$$ or $$a \mid c$$


**Problem 4:** 

Let $$n\geq 1$$.  Prove each of the following statements.

* (A) $$8 \mid 5^{2n} + 7$$.
* (B) $$15 \mid 2^{4n} - 1$$
* (C) $$5 \mid 3^{3n+1}  + 2^{n+1}$$
* (D) $$21 \mid 4^{n+1} + 5^{2n-1}$$
* (E) $$24 \mid 2\cdot 7^n + 3\cdot 5^n - 5$$

**Problem 5:** 

Compute by hand the following

* (A) $$\gcd(143,227)$$
* (B) $$\gcd(306,657)$$
* (C) $$\gcd(272,1479)$$

**Problem 6:**

Use the Euclidean algorithm to find integers $$x$$ and $$y$$ satisfying

* (A) $$\gcd(56,72) = 56x + 72y$$
* (B) $$\gcd(24,138) = 24x + 138y$$
* (C) $$\gcd(119,272) = 119x + 272y$$
* (D) $$\gcd(1769,2378) = 1769x + 2378y$$

**Problem 7:**

Let $$a,b,n$$ be integers with $$n\geq 1$$.  Prove that if $$a^n \mid b^n$$ then $$a \mid b$$.
