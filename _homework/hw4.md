### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* encoded into a modern interpretive dance routine, set to the tune of Yanky Doodle

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**

Prove that a number is divisible by $$3$$ if and only if the sum of its digits (base $$10$$) is divisible by $$3$$.

**Problem 2:**

Determine the last two digits of $$9^{9^9}$$.  [Hint: first considr the value of the exponent $$9^9$$ modulo $$10$$.

**Problem 3:**

Find the remainder when $$4444^{4444}$$ is divisible by $$9$$.

**Problem 4:** 

Convert each of the following numbers to the specified base.

* (A) $$127$$ to base $$2$$
* (B) $$1010101_2$$ to base $$10$$
* (C) $$$233$$ to base $$6$$.

**Problem 5:** 

Solve the following linear congruences.

* (A) $$36x\equiv 8\mod 102$$
* (B) $$34x\equiv 60\mod 98$$
* (C) $$140x\equiv 133\mod 301$$

**Problem 6:**

Solve each of the following 
* (A) $$x = 5 \mod 11$$, $$x = 14 \mod 29$$, $$x = 15 \mod 31$$,
* (B) $$x = 5 \mod 6$$, $$x =4 \mod 11$$, $$x = 3 \mod 17$$.

**Problem 7:** (Brahmagupta, 7th century A.D.)

When eggs in a basket are removed 2,
 3, 4, 5, 6 at a
time there remain, respectively, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 eggs. When they are taken out 7 at a time,
none are left over. Find the smallest number of eggs that could have been contained in
the basket.

**Problem 8:** (Ancient Chinese Problem.) A band of
 17 pirates stole a sack of gold coins. When they
tried to divide the fortune into equal portions, 3 coins remained.In the ensuing brawl over
who should get the extra coins, one pirate was killed. The wealth was redistributed, but
this time an equal division left 10 coins. Again an argument developed in which another
pirate was killed. But now the total fortune was evenly distributed among the survivors.
What was the least number of coins that could have been stolen?
