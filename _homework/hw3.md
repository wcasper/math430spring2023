### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* read aloud in class as a classic poem in iambic pentameter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**

* (A) Prove that if $$n>1$$ is a composite integer, then it must have a prime divisor $$p$$ with $$1 <  p\leq\sqrt{n}$$.
* (B) Determine whether $$701$$ is prime by testing its divisibility by all primes $$\leq \sqrt{701} \approx 26.476$$
* (C) Determine whether $$1009$$ is prime by testing its divisibility by all primes $$\leq \sqrt{1009} \approx 31.76$$

**Problem 2:**

Show that if $$n$$ is the product of three or more primes, then $$n$$ must be divisible by a prime $$p$$ with $$1\leq p\leq \sqrt[3]{n}$$.


**Problem 3:**

* (A) Prove that if $$2^n-1$$ is a prime number, then $$n$$ itself must also be a prime number.
* (B) Give an example of a prime integer which is not of the form $$2^p-1$$ for some prime $$p$$.
* (C) Show that $$2^{11}-1$$ is divisible by $$23$$ and therefore not prime.

**Problem 4:** 

A farmer purchased 100 head of livestock for a total cost of $4000. Prices were as follow:
calves, $120 each; lambs, $50 each; piglets, $25 each. If the farmer obtained at least one
animal of each type, how many of each did he buy?

**Problem 5:** 

Use congruence to prove each of the following statements

* (A) $$13\mid 3^{n+2} + 4^{2n+1}$$
* (B) $$27\mid 2^{5n+1} + 5^{n+2}$$
* (C) $$43\mid 6^{n+2} + 7^{2n+1}$$


**Problem 6:**

Use congruence to prove

$$89\mid 2^{44}-1\quad\text{and}\quad 97\mid 2^{48}-1.$$


**Problem: 7**

Let $$m>1$$ be an integer and $$p$$ be prime.  Choose $$k\geq 0$$ such that $$p^k \leq m < p^{k+1}$$.
Prove that the number of times $$p$$ divides $$m!$$ is

$$\sum_{j=1}^k \lfloor m/p^j \rfloor.$$
