Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.

a) If $$n$$ divides $$2^n-2$$, then $$n$$ is prime

b) If $$14\mid a^2$$ then $$14\mid a$$

c) Any number is equivalent modulo $$8$$ to one of the numbers in $$\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4\}$$

d) Chebyshev's estimate says that there are at least $$n\log(2)/\log(2n)$$ primes less than $$2n$$

e) The number $$1434_7$$ is divisible by $$6$$.

## Problem 2

a) Describe the Sieve of Eratosthenes

b) State the Chinese Remainder Theorem

c) Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be integers.  Write the definition of $$a$$ being congruent to $$b$$ modulo $$n$$.

## Problem 3

a) Give, with justification, a nontrivial factor of $$2^{2023}-1$$.  [Hint: $$2023 = 7\cdot 17^2$$]

b) Give, with justification, a nontrivial factor of $$2^{28}+1$$.

## Problem 4

Find all solution of the following equations

a) $$23x + 14y = 200$$, with $$x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$$

b) $$3x\equiv 4\mod 20$$

## Problem 5

a) Prove that if $$a\equiv b\mod n$$, then $$ac\equiv bc\mod n$$.

b) Prove that if $$ac\equiv bc\mod n$$ and $$\gcd(c,n) = 1$$, then $$a\equiv b\mod n$$.


## Problem 6

a) Find, with justification, the last three digits of $$7^{999}$$

b) Let $$p$$ be prime.  Show that if $$a^2\equiv 1\mod p$$, then $$a\equiv 1$$ or $$a\equiv -1$$.

## Problem 7

Find all solutions of the system of equations

$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{c}
2x\equiv 3\mod 5\\
4x\equiv 2\mod 6\\
3x\equiv 2\mod 7
\end{array}\right.$$

satisfying the property that $$0\leq x < 210$$.
