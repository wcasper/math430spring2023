Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.
Here $$n$$ is an arbitrary positive integer.

a) If $$f(n)$$ is multiplicative and $$f(3) = 2$$, then $$f(9)$$ must be $$4$$.

b) For any odd prime $$p$$, the number of quadratic residues is the same as the number of quadratic nonresidues.

c) $$99!$$ is equivalent to $$1$$ modulo $$101$$

d)  8911 = 7 · 19 · 67 is a Carmichael number

e)  If $$1234x6789$$ is divisible by $$9$$, then $$x=0$$

## Problem 2

a) State Gauss's Lemma

b) State Gauss's Theorem

c) State the definition of a quadratic residue mod $$n$$

d) State the definition of a composite number

e) State the Quadratic Reciprocity Law

## Problem 3

a) Use the Euclidean algorithm to find all integer solution to

$$37x + 41y = -3.$$

Carefully show your work!

b) Find all values of $$x$$ with $$37x\equiv 38$$ mod $$41$$.

## Problem 4

Suppose that $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$ are two multiplicative arithmetic functions whose first few values are given in the table below.

$$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
x    & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
f(x) & 1 & 3 & 2 & 7 & 5 & 6 & 4 \\
g(x) & 1 & 1 & 7 & 9 & 2 & 7 & 1
\end{array}
$$

a) Find the value of $$f(420)$$.

b) Suppose that $$h(x)$$ satisfies

$$f(n) = \sum_{d\mid n} h(d).$$

Find the value of $$h(60)$$.

c) Determine the value of the Dirichlet convolution

$$(f * g)(420)$$

[Hint: to make it easier, use the fact that $$f * g$$ is multiplicative]


## Problem 5
