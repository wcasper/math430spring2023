Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.
Here $$n$$ is an arbitrary positive integer.

a) If $$x^2\equiv 1\mod n$$ then $$x\equiv \pm 1$$ mod $$n$$.

b) $$\phi(9)=\phi(3)\phi(3) = (3-1)(3-1) = 4$$.

c) The Mobius function is the Dirichlet inverse of the constant function $$f(x)=1$$.

d) For any integer $$a$$, $$a^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1\mod n$$

e) The value of $$\mu(90)$$ is $$1$$

## Problem 2

a) State Gauss's Theorem and the Mobius Inversion of Gauss's Theorem.

b) Write down all integers $$n$$ with $$\phi(n) = 4$$.

c) State the definition of a arithmetic function $$f(n)$$ being multiplicative.

## Problem 3

Determine the value of each of the following sums.

a) $$\sum_{d\mid 1000} d$$ 

b) $$\sum_{d\mid 1000} \mu(d)$$

c) $$\sum_{d\mid 1000} d\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)$$

## Problem 4

Find all solution of the following equations

a) Calculate $$\phi(576)$$

b) Determine the order of $$3$$ modulo $$301$$.

## Problem 5

Suppose that $$p$$ and $$q$$ are two distinct odd integers.
Prove that there is no primitive root modulo $$pq$$.

## Problem 6

Find all integers $$n$$ satisfying

$$\sum_{d\mid n} \mu(d)\phi(d) = 2$$.

## Problem 7

Consider the prime number $$p=2011$$.

a) How many integers $$x$$ are there with $$1\leq x  < p$$ whose order is $$2010$$?

b) How many integers $$x$$ are there with $$1\leq x  < p$$ whose order is $$7$$?

c) How many integers $$x$$ are there with $$1\leq x  < p$$ whose order is $$10$$?

d) Given that $$3$$ is a primitive root of $$2011$$, find (up to congruence modulo $$2011$$) all solutions of the equation

$$x^{10}\equiv 1\mod 2011.$$

e) Given that $$3$$ is a primitive root of $$2011$$, find (up to congruence modulo $$2011$$) all integers whose order is $$10$$.
