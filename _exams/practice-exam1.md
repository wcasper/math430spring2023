Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.

a) Any integer can be expressed in the form $$4j + 5k$$ for some integers $$j$$ and $$k$$

b) The Well-Ordering Principle is equivalent to the Axiom of Induction

c) Every integer is divisible by $$0$$

d) $$\gcd(-33,-21) = -3$$

e) $$\gcd(15-6q,6) = 3$$ for any integer $$q$$

## Problem 2

a) State the Well-Ordering Principle

b) State the Division Algorithm

c) Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be integers.  Write the definition of the greatest common divisor of $$a$$ and $$b$$.

## Problem 3

a) Use the Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of $$851$$ and $$222$$.

b) Write the greatest common divisor from part $$(a)$$ as an integer linear combination of $$851$$ and $$222$$.

## Problem 4

Prove that $$2^{2023}+1$$ will be divisible by $$3$$.

## Problem 5

Use induction to prove $$\frac{(2n)!}{n!2^n}$$ is an integer for all $$n\geq 0$$.

## Problem 6

Let $$a$$ be an integer.
Prove that $$3a^2+2$$ cannot be a perfect square.

[Hint: Assume $$3a^2+2=k^2$$ and apply the Division Algorithm to $$k$$ and $$3$$.]

## Problem 7

Let $$F_1, F_2,\dots$$ be the Fibonacci numbers.  Prove that the greatest common divisor of $$F_k$$ and $$F_{k+1}$$ is always $$1$$.
