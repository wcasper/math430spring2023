title: What is number theory
---

Number theory is the branch of mathematics which primarily studies whole numbers or integers.
While integers seem like very simple objects to study, their consideration leads to a plethora of easy to state but hard to solve problems.

**Example:**
One example of a problem in number theory which is difficult to solve is to
find all **primitive pythagorean triples**, ie. triples of relatively prime
integers $$(a,b,c)$$ satisfying $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$.

**Example:**
A second example is to find all triples of nonzero integers $$(a,b,c)$$
satisfying $$a^3+b^3=c^3$$.  Interestingly, one can prove that there are no
such triples!  This result is known as **Fermat's Last Theorem** and was proved
by Andrew Wiles in 1995.

**Example:**
A third example is to prove that every positive even integer greater than $$2$$
can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.

As we see, we can create very intricate problems about integers, despite having a strong familiarity with their basic properties.
The integers themselves are the fundamental building block of all number systems, so theorems that you can prove about them reflect the foundations of mathematics itself.



In this class, we will learn **elementary number theory**, wherein numbers are studied without relying on the tools of geometry or complex analysis.
Specifically, we will study
* divisibility properties of integers
* prime numbers and their distributions
* modular arithmetic
* Fermat's theorem
* special arithmetic functions
* primitive and prime roots
* quadratic reciprocity

This constitutes essentially the first 9 chapters of our primary textbook *Elementary Number Theory* by David Burton 7th Ed.
